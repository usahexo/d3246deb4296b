<h1 id="Nanotechnology"><a href="#Nanotechnology" class="headerlink" title="Nanotechnology"></a>Nanotechnology</h1><p>This advanced course provides students with an introduction to nanotechnology – the study of materials at the atomic or molecular scale. Major topics covered in this course include nanoparticle synthesis methods, fabrication techniques, optical properties, and thermal properties. Students who take this course will gain a deep understanding of how nanomaterials are used in various technological applications.</p>
<h1 id="What-types-of-research-projects-does-the-department-typically-undertake"><a href="#What-types-of-research-projects-does-the-department-typically-undertake" class="headerlink" title="What types of research projects does the department typically undertake?"></a>What types of research projects does the department typically undertake?</h1><p>The department typically conducts three types of research projects: fundamental, application, and development. Fundamental projects explore the basic principles underlying a technology or field of inquiry. Application projects use existing knowledge to solve practical problems. Development projects create new knowledge that can lead to disruptive technologies or methodological advances.</p>
<p>Fundamental research is often curiosity-driven, and its outcomes are not always predictable. However, it is essential for advancing our understanding of the world and for developing new technologies. Application research aims to solve specific problems using knowledge that is already available. It can provide immediate benefits to society while also advancing our understanding of the problem domain. Development research results in new knowledge and technological innovations. It can have a major impact on society by leading to transformative changes in how we live and work.</p>
<p>The department typically conducts fundamental, application, and development research projects.</p>
